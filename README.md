Project Vinyl that is a search engine that utilizes the itunes API to find songs. The priority of this assignment was to add user creation that is connected to a `Mysql` database. `Node.js` & `Express.js` were used for the backend API. The `dotenv` & `bcrypt` npm packages were used for enviornment variables and password hashing to assist with login authentication. `Sequelize` was used for model creation and database management. `Express-Handlebars` was the HTML templating engine used for the front end of this application.
